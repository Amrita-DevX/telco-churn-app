# 📉 Telco Customer Churn Prediction App

An end-to-end machine project that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their usage behavior, contract type, and demographics. Built with **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**, this app helps telecom companies understand and visualize churn patterns interactively.

## 📊 Streamlit app

**🧾  User Input Interface &  Churn Prediction Output**

**📈  Business Dashboard**

The dashboard provides answers to the following:

1. **Churn Distribution** – % of customers churned  
2. **Contract Type** – Month-to-month vs 1/2-year contracts  
3. **Tenure Analysis** – Are new users more likely to churn?  
4. **Charges Impact** – Monthly vs Total Charges  
5. **Services Used** – Internet, Online Backup, Streaming, etc.  
6. **Demographics** – Gender, Senior Citizens, Dependents  
7. **Payment Method** – Is auto-pay safer?  
8. **Actionable Segments** – High-risk customer profiles
